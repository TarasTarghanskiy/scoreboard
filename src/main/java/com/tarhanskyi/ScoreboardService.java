//The scoreboard supports the following operations:
//1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
// This should capture following parameters:
//  a. Home team
//  b. Away team
//2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
//team score. (id?)
//        3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
//4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the
//same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the
//scoreboard.

// Keep it simple

// Do not forget about edge cases!

// Just a simple library implementation.
// Focus on Quality.
// Use Test-Driven Development (TDD)
// pay attention to: OO design, Clean Code and adherence to SOLID principles.
// Please share your solution with a link to a source control repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)
// commit history is important
